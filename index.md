### Structure-Preserving Oversampling for Imbalanced Multivariate Time Series

Creating synthetic minority samples for highly im- balanced multivariate time series is a challenging task due to the fact that adjacent data points along temporal and feature dimensions can be highly correlated. Traditional interpolation-based oversampling techniques such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling does not preserve the underlying covariance structure of the time series data and thus can compromise classification performance. We propose a novel framework addressing the task of over-sampling highly imbalanced multivariate time series data with the goal of preserving the underlying covariance structure.

### News Headline Generation

In this project I am exploring different NLP models to generate headline for a news article. Here is an example article published in Chicago Tribune on 11/22/2020 about Donald Trump's team requesting a recount of votes in Georgia.


*"President Donald Trump’s campaign requested a recount of votes in the Georgia presidential race on Saturday, a day after state officials certified results showing Democrat Joe Biden won the state, as his legal team presses forward with attacks alleging widespread fraud without proof.
Georgia’s results showed Biden beating Trump by 12,670 votes out of about 5 million cast, or 0.25%.State law allows a candidate to request a recount if the margin is less than 0.5%.Republican Gov. Brian Kemp formalized the state’s slate of 16 presidential electors.
The Trump campaign sent a hand-delivered letter to the secretary of state’s office requesting the recount in an election that has been fraught with unfounded accusations of fraud by Trump and his supporters.
A Trump legal team statement said: “Today, the Trump
campaign filed a petition for recount in Georgia. We are focused on ensuring that every aspect of Georgia State Law and the U.S. Constitution are followed so that every legal vote is counted. President Trump and his campaign continue to insist on an honest recount in Georgia, which has to include signature matching and other vital safeguards.”*

Headline generated by abstractive model: **uk hopes of certainty for ballot recount in voter race**
Original human-generated headline: **Trump team requests another recount of Georgia’s day after results certified in Joe Biden’s victory**
