### Structure-Preserving Oversampling for Imbalanced Multivariate Time Series

Creating synthetic minority samples for highly im- balanced multivariate time series is a challenging task due to the fact that adjacent data points along temporal and feature dimensions can be highly cor- related. Traditional interpolation-based oversam- pling techniques such as Synthetic Minority Over- sampling does not preserve the underlying covari- ance structure of the time series data and thus can compromise classification performance. We propose a novel framework addressing the task of over-sampling highly imbalanced multivariate time series data with the goal of preserving the underlying covariance structure.
